# snakes-and-ladders
Command Line snakes and ladders game game, where the user can decide to generate a board with specified parameters and incorportate multiple players locally. This program does not make use of any loops nor containers, and instead uses entirely recursive methods and linked lists to perform game logic and manage the user interface. Upon starting the game, the user(s) will be required to press enter to advance, and the game will simulate a random dice roll for every move. The user can also choose to simulate the rest of the game and avoid pressing enter after every turn. At the end of the game, the score of the winner will be stored in a binary tree, also using recursive methods.
